										<h2>Unit 1-3</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										The unit has highlighted the importance of critical thinking in the pursuit of scientific research. During the phase, we also learned how to identify the research problem by leveraging the literature review. The unit also taught us, how to identify quality research text, the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning (Miessler,2020), and how to identify open-ended and close-ended questions.
									</p>
									<p>
										The unit has also taught us the difference between Exploratory Research, Mixed Methods Research, Conclusive Research, and Qualitative Research (British Research Methodology, N.D.).

									</p>
									<p>
										In the collaborative discussion, I chose the topic where Rouge Service offered guaranteed uptime which was leveraged by the criminal organization to disrupt the life of innocent people. The government agencies along with security vendors used DOS to takedown the Rouge Service networks when Rouge Service did not comply with the request from the government agencies.

									</p>
									<p>
										In this scenario, both the government and Rouge Service were at fault. The Rouge Service did not add the disclaimer, stating the limitation of use of their service, while the government agencies destroyed data for an organization as well as all the clients including innocent clients.

												<h3>Reflections</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The module course helped to understand the dynamics of vulnerability scanning and threat hunting. Apart from the regular learning, there have been interesting discussions related to the different types of attacks that have happened previously and their impact on the organization and the customers(<a href="Dublin Mint Office.docx">Week 8 Dublin Mint Office - effect GDPR related case</a>).</p>

<p>The module included hosting a website using AWS (cloud) which provided me with the understanding of Elastic-Beanstalk and other services provided by cloud computing organizations. The process educated the following:</p>

<li>How to manage websites over the cloud.</li>
<li>How to activate/deactivate ports.</li>
<li>Access SSH using the public key.</li>
<p>This knowledge will be helpful in future if there is a cloud deployment using AWS and will allow the students to add pre-configured security measures.<p>

<p>Module 4 was based on the recon of the website, please check the output for the module (<a href="Initial Recon Output.docx">Week 4 Discussion</a>) <p>

<p> Module 6 was based on the design approach implemented by the team and the tools to be used for threat hunting (<a href="Group 2 - NISM Design Document.docx">Design Document</a>). </p>
<p>The Final part of the assignment was the identification of vulnerabilities, security risks associated, and remediation plans. The implementation of the learnings from the IRM module provided the groundwork for the identification of risks and the remediation plan (<a href="NISM -  Executive Summary.docx">Executive Summary</a>).</p>

												<h3>Penetration Testing Tool Outputs and Analysis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Output from the following tools (please click on the name for the output details)
												<li><a href="NMAP.docx">NMAP</a></li>

											</p>
											<p> The Data collected from the above tools indicated the following findings:</p>
											<p>FND 1: The site is currently missing a Load Balancer or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), resulting in a successful D-DoS attack. This weakness in the system can result in service disruption.</p>
											<p>Remediation Plan (Recommendations): Use a Load balancer or IPS</p>

<p>FND 2: This plugin is a SYN 'half-open' port scanner. It shall be reasonably quick even against a firewalled target. Note that SYN scans are less intrusive than TCP (full connect) scans against broken services, but they might cause problems for less robust firewalls and also leave unclosed connections on the remote target if the network is loaded.</p>
											<p>Remediation Plan: </p>
											<li>Protect your target with an IP filter.</li>
											<li>Implement a hardware/software Firewall.</li>
											<p>
												
											</p>

<p>FND 3: The website is susceptible to Man In The Middle attack, and the data transferred is not encrypted since it has HTTP port 80 open.</p>
											<p>Remediation Plan: Block port 80</p>

<p>FND 4: The SSH port number, SSH version, the Apache webserver version, the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the system, and the Operating System type is visible can result in targeted D-Dos and Brute force attack. The SSH server is configured to support Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) encryption. This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext message from the ciphertext.</p>
											<p>Remediation Plan: </p>
											<li>Change SSH configuration and update Apache to the latest version.</li>
											<li>Contact the vendor or consult product documentation to disable CBC mode cypher encryption, and enable CTR or GCM cypher mode encryption.</li>
											<p>
												
											</p>

<p>FND 5: The system is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery and can lead to unauthorized privileged access to the attacker</p>
											<p>Remediation Plan: </p>
											<li>Block port 80</li>
<li>Enable X-Framework Option</li>
<li>Implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive</li>
<li>Change FRAMESET to "DENY"</li>
<li>X-XSS-Protection header to be defined</li>
<li>Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options to be set as 'nosniff'</li>
<li>Block access to the following pages to ensure JavaScript source files are loaded from only trusted sources, and the sources can't be controlled by end-users of the application.</li>

										<h2>Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The overall module created the thought process of how a web server can be penetrated and identify the loopholes, for a similar project in the future following will be the approach:</p>
<li>Explore the source code and identify the weakness</p>
<li>Explore the known weakness on the hosted apache server</p>
<li>Launch a targetted attack to explore the vulnerabilities</p>

<p>Among the multiple findings (<a href="NISM -  ePortFolio.docx">ePortFolio</a>), the availability of the source code directly from the webpage has been identified as critical. This can lead to a direct attack on the website leading to unauthorized access to the system. </p>
